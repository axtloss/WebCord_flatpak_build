# WebCord_flatpak_build
A "wrapper" repository for building flatpaks of WebCord, doesn't build successfully as of now.

To try building this app all dependencies I needed were installed with a single command of 
```sudo dnf install flatpak-builder npm```
A fedora 36 container from dockerhub was used.
